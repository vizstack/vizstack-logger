# Introduction

VZ-Logger is an open-source application for visual logging. It enables you to replace print statements with powerful visual log messages, so you can more easily track and explore complex output.

Despite the abundance of step-through debuggers, many programmers prefer the simplicity of loggers for debugging. This approach ranges from the trusty stdout print statement (for small projects and temporary hacks) to full logging solutions. However, these existing solutions only allow simple string messages.

Consider a program that builds a data structure like a linked list or directed graph; it would be much better to visualize this structure, rather than devise some serialization scheme so it can be printed as a string. Or if you want to find trends within list of numbers, it may be desirable to plot them as a line graph, without having to find and set up a plotting library.

VZ-Logger makes producing such output effortless, so you can quickly fix bugs and inspect that your code is performing as expected.
